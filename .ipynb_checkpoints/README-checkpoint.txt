Create a New Git Repository

1)  Create a repository on Github
2)  Open a git terminal in jupyter lab
3)  change to directory where you want to project to live
4)  git clone <git url>
5)  create a readme.txt in new project

First Commit (assumes a readme is created)
--Make sure you are the project directory when you do this...

git add --all
git commit --all
git push --all

*Note:  I had problems using git with JupyterLab if I didn't do the first commit through the Terminal.  After the first commit/push, I was able to 
use Git > Interface.
